# Olly's Rust Project

This project is designed to increase my exposure to the rust programming language and improve the quality of code I write in production apps @ Vortexa.

### Useful commands

- `cargo run` - builds and runs the app.
- `cargo watch` - monitors the source code and triggers commands every time a file changes, E.G.
    - `cargo watch -x check`
    - `cargo watch -x run`
    - `cargo watch -x check -x run`
- `cargo test` - runs the unit/integration tests.
- `cargo clippy` - checks the linting and suggests fixes for issues.
- `cargo fmt` - checks formatting.
